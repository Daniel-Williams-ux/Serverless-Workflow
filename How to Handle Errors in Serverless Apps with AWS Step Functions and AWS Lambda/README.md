# How to Handle Errors in Serverless Apps with AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda

## Content

1. design and run a serverless workflow using AWS Step Functions to handle errors
2. create an AWS Lambda function, which will mock calls to a RESTful API and return various response codes and exceptions
3. create a state machine with Retry and Catch capabilities that responds with different logic depending on the exception raised.

### Implementation

Step 1: Create a Lambda function to mock an API
Step 2: Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
Step 3: Create a Step Functions state machine
Step 4: Test your error-handling workflow
Step 5: Inspect the execution of your state machine
